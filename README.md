## Overview

### The challenge

Create a dashboard using any tool of your choice to analyze tech stock (between nvidia, twitter, tesla)

### Notebooks
Two notebooks were created during the course of this project
- The [invest](./invest.ipynb) notebook which contains EDA using matplotlib, pandas.
- The [panel_stock_dashboard](./panel_stock_dashboard.ipynb) which contains the code used to build the dashboard using panel.

### Excel Files
- All of the data extracted from yahoo finance is contained in the [fin data sheet](./fin_data.xlsx), which can be used for further analysis.
- The [fin main sheet](./fin_main_sheet.xlsx) solely has the tickers' closing price and volume.

## My process

### Built with

Python using libraries such as:
- Panel
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib etc.

### What I learned

Learning about the panel libarary made this project a whole lot easier. From the documentations to the ease of implementation, panel was wonderful.

### Continued development

Can't wait for when it becomes easier to source a panel .ipynb or .py file into pyscript making it interactie on the web

### Useful resources

- [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/index.html) - Panel documentation.
- [Thu Vu Panel/HvPlot Video](https://youtu.be/uhxiXOTKzfs) - This is an amazing video which helped me understand panel. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to give panel a try.
